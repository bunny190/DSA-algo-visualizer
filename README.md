# DSA-algo-visualizer
This project is an interactive GUI-based visualizer developed using Python's Tkinter library to simulate the step-by-step working of common sorting and searching algorithms. It helps users understand how different algorithms operate by showing dynamic transitions, bar height changes, and color-coded comparisons in real time.
